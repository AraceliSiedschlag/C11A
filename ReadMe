Answer to question "What are 3 good practices related to exception handling?"
One good practice related to exception handling is to include the stack-trace so you can see
where an error is originating from in order to fix the root cause. Another good practicce
related to error handeling is to provide meaningful exception messages so you know what is 
happening or why you got the error in the first place rather than a general message. Finally,
a good practice related to exception handeling is to avoid empty catch blocks or ones that just
return null.
